|operator-html-escape| provides |operator| to escape HTML entities.
>
	nmap <c-h> <Plug>(operator-html-escape)
	nmap <c-u> <Plug>(operator-html-unescape)

This has similar feature with this wiki page:
	http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/HTML_entities

But the fact is that it is certainly NOT the same
because this is operator.
so this can work with |text-objects|.
You can also enhance |text-objects| by |textobj-user|.

Requirements:
- Vim 7.2 or later
- |operator-user| 0.0.5 or later (vimscript#2692)
